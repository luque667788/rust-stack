# Stack Implementation in Rust

This project is a simple implementation of a stack data structure in Rust. It was created a while ago for learning purposes and can serve as an example for people who are learning Rust.

## Features

- **Generics**: The stack is implemented in a linked-list using Rust's generics, allowing it to store elements of any type.
- **Pointers**: The project demonstrates the use of pointers (`Box`) to manage heap-allocated memory.
- **Stack Data Structure**: Basic stack operations such as `push` and `pop` are implemented.
